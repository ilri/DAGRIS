# DAGRIS

The Domestic Animal Genetic Resources Information System (DAGRIS) is an information system designed to facilitate the compilation, organization and dissemination of information on the origin, distribution, diversity, present use and status of indigenous farm animal genetic resources from past and present research results in an efficient way. The underlying concept is that such information provides the necessary basis for developing breed improvement as well as conservation programs.

The working objectives of DAGRIS are:
* Compile and organize information on farm animal genetic resources from all available sources;
* Maintain the integrity and validity of the information, and
* Disseminate the information in a readily accessible way to all key stakeholders.

DAGRIS has previously been developed as a classic ASP web application with a Microsoft SQL 2000 database back-end. The lack of proper documentation for this custom system has made its maintenance and/or enhancement very difficult. For this reason, the CIGAR IT/Knowledge Management team has proposed to port the entire system (DAGRIS) to [Drupal](http://drupal.org), a popular opensource Content Management System (CMS) with a very high rate of adoption within different institutions for its modularity and scalability.
